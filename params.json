If it is your first time running the bot, you'll have to input your keys. If you've already run the bot and saved your creds, they'll be stored for future use and you can load those on each run. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Future Features\r\n- Abuse checking: Make sure users aren't spamming the bot\r\n- Extended modes: Search for nearby stops, get more than 1 result back, etc\r\n- Automatic Reminders: Ask the bot to remind you 15, 30, 45mins before a bus is scheduled to arrive\r\n","google":"UA-68375423-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
