{"name":"WpgTransitBot","tagline":"Using Winnipeg Transit's developer API and Tweepy to replicate Transit's bustxt service on Twitter","body":"####Requirements\r\n- You will need to have the following installed:\r\n  - [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) (`pip install tweepy==3.2.0`)\r\n    - due to a known issue in the newest version of Tweepy, make sure to use V3.2.0\r\n  - Dateutil (`pip install python-dateutil`)\r\n  - Pytz (for timezone adjustement) (`pip install pytz`)\r\n  - That's it!\r\n\r\n####Authentication\r\nTo set up Twitter's/Tweepy's authentication, create a Python file (secrets.py) in the source directory with the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nACCESS_TOKEN = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'\r\nACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'\r\nCONSUMER_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'\r\nCONSUMER_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'\r\n\r\nTRANSIT_API_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'\r\n```\r\n\r\n<i>(This is a temporary solution, eventually I plan on creating a way to input these on the first run or use a .config file)</i>\r\n\r\n#### Future Features\r\n- Abuse checking: Make sure users aren't spamming the bot\r\n- Extended modes: Search for nearby stops, get more than 1 result back, etc\r\n- Automatic Reminders: Ask the bot to remind you 15, 30, 45mins before a bus is scheduled to arrive\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
