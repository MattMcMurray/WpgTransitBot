####Requirements
- You will need to have [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) installed (`pip install tweepy`)

To set up Twitter's/Tweepy's authentication, create a Python file (Secrets.py) in the source directory with the following:

```python
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
CONSUMER_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```
