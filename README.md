# WpgTransitBot
Using Winnipeg Transit's 

####Requirements
- You will need to have [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) installed (`pip install tweepy`)
- I also used colorama for cross-platform coloured output, but this should come packaged with Python if I'm not mistaken


####Authentication
To set up Twitter's/Tweepy's authentication, create a Python file (Secrets.py) in the source directory with the following:

```python
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
CONSUMER_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

<i>(This is a temporary solution, eventually I plan on creating a way to input these on the first run or use a .config file)</i>
